As a user with a To-Do list I want to be able to: 
- Add items to a list to remind the user of what they need to do. 
- Remove items as you complete them. 
- switch between views of All items, Active items, Completed Items.

Output box. If user inputs data and hits enter or clicks a add button then add data to list.

List of items If user has input data and it has been added to the list then options of Completing and deleting task becomes available. If user completes task on item, and completed button is used, item is then taken to the completed state. then if its in the completed section you have the option of removing your item with a delete button. Be able to use local storage to store items in it

Buttons to navigate Use buttons to pull in the different states for Completed, Active, All items.
